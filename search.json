    "text": "An expanding array of observational data now enables social, economic and environmental behaviours to be researched in a large-scale and empirical way. This is exciting as there are increasing opportunities to effect evidence-based decision making in science, government and industry. In order to generate insights and draw conclusions, however, such data-intensive research relies on reasonably informal, interactive data analysis approaches: those that combine data graphics and statistics via computational notebooks (Observable, Quarto, Jupyter) or interactive data analysis tools such as Tableau and PowerBI. Unlike traditional scientific processes, we don’t know what an optimal and rigorous interactive analysis should look like and their success more often than not relies on the expertise and skills of the data scientist.\nOur proposed Theory & Methods Challenge will develop proposals for conducting and reporting data-intensive research in a more formal way. Our hope is that this activity will lay the foundations for rigorous interactive data analysis practices and guidelines for computational tools that underpin the next generation of analysis platforms. Through the workshop, we aim to explore three sub-challenges:\n\nModelling paradigms for data-driven science: establish what is distinctive about modelling in data-driven science by mapping out existing data-driven projects and the analysis practices they use\nInference and replicability in data-driven science: develop systematic ways of documenting the context under which analytical findings are made – a grammar for structuring exploratory research findings – so that inferences can be more formally reported.\nTools for progressing from analysis to communication: explore tools and technologies for documenting interactive data analysis processes with integrity – balancing claims to knowledge with informational complexity."

    "text": "Outcomes and potential for impact\nThe Challenge will aim for the following outcomes:\n\nFoundations for theoretically-guided, transparent and replicable interactive data analysis, leading to more rigorous data-driven science\nA systematic framework – a grammar – for describing interactive data-driven reasoning processes and the context under which inferences are made\nGuidelines for designing new generation data analysis tools and technologies that operationalise more formal, interactive data analysis practice\n\nWe anticipate impact on the following:\n\nAdvancing the science of data science – data science increasingly requires better established, formal forms of working. Our findings will contribute to the theoretical literature on how data-driven research practices could be better conducted and positioned to respond to the advances in data science and AI technologies.\nEcologically-valid, justified and plausible data-driven decisions – our work will support better documented analytical choices, e.g. model/assumptions that are justified and recorded along with contextual, background and researcher tacit knowledge. Such forms of practice will advance how data-driven artefacts can inform decisions and policies.\n\nTools and technologies for transparent, rigorous and reproducible data analysis practices – we will develop guidelines and blueprints for new generations of analytical tools that can recognise and facilitate rigorous analysis processes, from hypothesis generation through to modeling and communication."

    "text": "Welcome to our upcoming Turing Theory and Methods Challenge Fortnight (TMCF). Our challenge will take place in the British Library in summer 2024.\nThe ambition behind TMCFs is nicely laid out on the Alan Turing Institute’s web pages (below). Ours seeks to a address a problem familiar to data-driven research: the garden of forking paths fallacy (Gelman and Loken 2013).\n\nTheory and Methods Challenge Fortnights are intensive, two-week events where teams of 12 experts from across the Turing university partner network and external institutions worldwide collaborate to initiate work on tackling a foundational challenge in data science and artificial intelligence. Each event focuses on a specific theoretical or methodological challenge that has the potential to impact data science and artificial intelligence at a fundamental level.\nvia turing.ac.uk.\n\nWe have assembled a stellar organising team, and a very exciting set of participants – world-leaders in data science engineering and practice (to be finalised shortly). Alongside the challenge we intend to host public lectures and seminars – more news on this to follow.\nWe will update these pages through 2024 as planning and other preparatory work develops.\n\n\nCagatay Turkay and Roger Beecham, Challenge Leads"

    "section": "",
    "text": "A familiar challenge in data-driven science is that of inference. Generalising away from a sample to some target population is challenging when datasets are already large and population-level and observations subject to unknown confounding context. Replication is muddled by the number of analysis choices that are to be made and range of alternatives that could be pursued (the forking paths problem). How, then, can we ensure that the inferences and claims we make from exploratory analyses are properly contextualised?\nDrawing on expertise in Statistics, Human Computer Interaction and Spatial Econometrics, we will explore ways of systematically describing context in interactive data analysis. An outcome of this work may be to formulate a grammar for structuring exploratory research findings. For a stated finding, the grammar would require researchers to identify, using theory and prior knowledge: confounding context that is present/absent in their analysis, the spatiotemporal scale at which their stated finding is observed and how it may generalise outside of this; the weight of evidence in support of some theory implied by a finding relative to other plausible theories."

We will ask:\n\nHow relevant models are identified and selected;\nHow they are developed and refined; and\nThe processes through which they are analysed and evaluated.\n\nFrom these examples, we will document what is distinctive about model building in data-driven science."

The analysis process leaves behind a diverse trail of pathways explored, decisions made, failed attempts and also conclusions that satisfactory outcomes have been reached, i.e., when to stop an exploration? How can these analysis trails be documented, how can the provenance of these processes be recorded and serve as evidence and eventually as communicative artefacts?\nThis theme will focus on tools and technologies through which exploratory data analysis workflows can be documented, communicated and shared. Here we will explore the space of computational notebook environments – how they can be used to record and communicate interactive data analysis processes. Drawing on work from themes #1 and #2 we will identify examples of interactive data analyses, documented via computational notebooks, that balance complexity of information with claims to knowledge."
