## Constraints / checks for planning

* Structured activities rather than free-flow discussion / "talks".
* TMCF for *writing* outputs rather than open discussion / networking.
* Pre-meeting activities that we ask participants to perform, and communications, should establish above, and enable participants to come with ideas for writing.



## Structure for 5 days

*Note this is an initial plan to be iterated over.*

### Day  1 *Present* : Defense of positions

* Give each participant an extreme *position* that they have to argue / test the limits of.
* They elaborate on position, identify what it brings, its consequences and its future. Get people to write provocations relating to position. An example, the famous Anderson quote: "Big Data makes theory obsolete [sic]"
* They will present these positions on day 1, via 20 minute presentations.
* They should argue *for* that position with reference to their own work (this is a way of doing introductions).
* CT and RB to formulate these positions, and slightly informed by the work that individuals do.

### Day 2 *Write* : Documenting positions as blog posts

* From these positions participants will be allocated into groups. These might fall into disciplinary divides (*whether we want to encourage / discourage this is up for discussion*).
* As a group, they write up position with evidence and examples. These documents should be ?? word blog posts.
* We could impose a common structure on these blog posts (*to be discussed*)
* Blog posts are shared with participants

### Day 3 *Synthesise* : Organising positions and identifying consequences

*  Having read/understood positions, each participant identifies consequences for their own research. E.g. what position x,y,z would mean for their work/community.
*  This would be via quick presentations (little prep).
*  Rest of day, entire group works up a structure for the position paper.
*  Groups of individuals attached to sections.

### Day 4 *Write* : Paper

* Groups of individuals write sections to which they are attached.

### Day 5 *Consolidate* : Formulate plans for follow-ups

* Open discussion of Research Agenda, given work done
* Plans for second week of TMCF for *local* people

## Some themes that might form positions

* Heuristics trumps theory in data-driven research.  Model-building in data-driven research is best approached by consulting data and domain praxis and commonsense rather than isolated theory/ theoretical mechanisms.


* Knowledge claims can only be made through out-of-sample significance tests (extreme pre-registration).
* Exploratory analysis induces p-hacking
* Data graphics + visual analysis methods induce false discovery via unchecked multiple comparisons
* Data graphics + visual analysis methods are free from pitfalls of statistical analysis since they encourage informal calibration and expectation on inferences.
* Automated analysis is the best hope for doing bias-free research (e.g. removing human from scientific method)
* Visualization as data artefact (e.g. Simulation from null hypothesis -- Hops and lineups -- for exploring possible outcomes that might have been produced by data, not for marking out confidence intervals)
* For research to have value, it must be underpinned by crisply stated causal claims.
* The only interesting/useful hypothesis tests are those where the "null hypothesis" is *not* rejected (where p>.05).

Tensions that above try to expose:

* automation / human-in-loop / human-mediated
* pre-registration versus free-form exploration versus heuristics (recipes for doing data-driven research)
* limits to modelling / diagnostics
* practice of data-driven science / tools
