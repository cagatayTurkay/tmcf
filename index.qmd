## Our TMCF

> *Theory & Methods Challenge Fortnights are intensive, two-week events where teams of 12 experts from across the Turing university partner network and external institutions worldwide collaborate to initiate work on tackling a foundational challenge in data science and artificial intelligence. Each event focuses on a specific theoretical or methodological challenge that has the potential to impact data science and artificial intelligence at a fundamental level.*

Welcome to our upcoming Turing Theory & Methods Challenge Fortnight (TMCF). [Our challenge](challenge/) will take place in the **British Library** in **summer 2024**.

The ambition behind TMCFs is nicely laid out on the Alan Turing Institute's website (above). Ours seeks to a address a problem familiar to data-driven research: *the garden of forking paths fallacy* [@gelman_garden_2013]. We have assembled a stellar [team](team/) to work on the challenge -- world-leaders in data science engineering and practice.  Alongside the challenge we intend to host public lectures and seminars -- more news on this to follow.

We will update these pages through 2024 as planning and other preparatory work develops.
